animatedEmoji.py :
  The code contains an Emoji class which serves to hold the emoji pixels which are being displayed and the display function to easily display
  the selected emoji. The main class uses a while loop to cycle through the 3 different emojis by resetting a count when it reaches the end.

monitorAndDisplay.py :
  The class Temp stores an array which has the numbers stored as 1 and 0 to produce the desired number in a 5x3 design later on the switch.
  The code determines the temperature by getting the temperature from both the humidity and pressure sensor, using code provided by the lecture,
  though because there was a bug where the sensors would return a 0 when first started they are checked a second time to ensure the right
  temperature was provided. When displaying the temperature the code checks to see if it has two digits, should it be smaller than 10 then a 0
  is put in front to display two digits.
